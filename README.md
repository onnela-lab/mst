# Inferring the minimum spanning tree from a sample network

This is the companion code to the paper "Inferring the minimum spanning tree from a sample network" by Jonathan Larson and Jukka-Pekka Onnela. This is the code used to run all the simulations described in the paper, and to analyze the data. The data were obtained from the Primary Infection Resource Consortium (PIRC; https://www.pirc.ucsd.edu), which must approve the release of data to a third party.
